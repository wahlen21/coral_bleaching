# Conclusion

Coral reefs play a major role in the overall health of not only marine life, but also our world. With the provided visualizations and insights, we hope to contribute to addressing our oceanic health crisis and emphasize the need for increased attention to the deteriorating health of the coral reefs.

It is important to note that the disparity in observation counts may highlight geographic biases in research and funding rather than actual differences in bleaching severity. This disparity could lead to underrepresentation and severe underestimates of coral bleaching in regions with fewer resources. Increasing monitoring in underrepresented regions, like Africa and the Middle East, may help build a more comprehensive global understanding of coral bleaching. This data emphasizes the importance of targeted conservation efforts in regions with high observation counts and the need for equitable global research efforts.

Key recommendations include increasing global monitoring efforts, particularly in underrepresented countries, to create a more comprehensive understanding of coral reef health. Our graphs underscore the need for equitable research funding and international collaboration to address geographic biases in the data. In addition, they highlight the need to provide more up-to-date coral health measurements that can accurately indicate the severity of coral bleaching in future years. Our visualizations show that coral bleaching is rapidly increasing with time, and the significant bleaching challenges faced in the Torres Strait & Great Barrier Reef require urgent conservation action. The high density of observations along the reef's entire extent reflects its importance as a global conservation priority and the focus of significant monitoring resources.

Further analysis could focus on understanding environmental factors contributing to severity variations in specific regions, such as observation depth, sea surface temperature, or nutrient concentrations. Collectively, these visualizations and analyses stress the growing impacts of climate change on coral reefs and highlight the need for targeted interventions to mitigate environmental stressors.
