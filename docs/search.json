    "text": "1 Introduction\nCoral reefs are one of the most diverse types of ecosystems in the world. Coral is largely made up of individual animals called coral polyps, which are the organisms primarily responsible for building reefs. Thousands of species rely on corals and the reefs they form for survival: Due to the diversity of life found within the habitats created by corals, reefs are often referred to as the “rainforests of the sea.” About 25% of the ocean’s fish population depend on healthy coral reefs; fish and other organisms find shelter, food, as well as breed and raise their young among the many nooks and crannies formed by corals [1].\nCoral bleaching is a major phenomenon that has been detrimentally affecting coral reefs and sea life worldwide. When water temperatures increase – or more generally when corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients – they will expel the beneficial symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) living in their tissues, causing the coral to turn completely white. This event is called coral bleaching. Once a coral bleaches, it is not dead; corals can survive a bleaching event, however they are under much more stress and are subject to mortality [2]. On April 15, 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed the world has been experiencing a global coral bleaching event. Bleaching-level heat stress, as remotely monitored and predicted by NOAA Coral Reef Watch, has been extensive across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean basins. As of August 20, 2024, 75.0% of coral reefs worldwide have been impacted by bleaching-level heat stress since January 1, 2023, the largest percentage of any global coral bleaching event in history to date [3].\nWe chose this topic due to the pressing stakes of this global environmental crisis. We aim to explore which parts of the world are experiencing the largest impacts of coral bleaching, and to what extent has damage been done? Is there any correlation between the subregions and longitude, latitude coordinates of coral bleaching reports and bleaching severity? In addressing these questions through visualization and data exploration, we hope our analysis lends itself to the greater discussion and importance of shedding light on the urgency of coral reef preservation for the greater health of oceanic ecosystems.\n[1] https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/marine-life/coral-reef-ecosystems [2] https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html [3] https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/research/coral_bleaching_report.php",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nWe discovered this Coral Bleaching Dataset from the Harvard WorldFish Dataverse. Per Harvard Dataverse, an initial database of bleaching observations was compiled by the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) using a variety of sources. This database has been expanded by Dr. J. Oliver, Mr. Y. Yusuf and Ms. Nurulhuda Ahmad Fatan from WorldFish, using information from the ReefBase database, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), the CoralList, and other sources of information. This dataset was published on January 1, 2016. [4] This dataset is provided in Excel format, and we plan to import the data via the read_excel() function in R.\nThe data consists of 28 feature columns and 6,190 row entries. Only about 11 of these columns have complete or mostly complete entries–which are the more useful columns–containing geographic information of various degrees as well as bleaching severity: Region, Subregion, Country Location, Longitude & Latitude coordinates, Bleaching_Severity, Severity_Code, Depth, Year, among others. This dataset also includes observations indicating no bleaching. Even though this dataset was published in 2016, this is shockingly one of the more recent datasets we could find related to coral bleaching; thus, there have been no updates to this specific dataset. The low frequency of updates available in measuring coral health on this scope further aids in highlighting the disparity of data availability and lack of necessary public attention on this crucial area of oceanic health within the Earth and Environmental Sciences.\n[4] ReefBase, 2016, “Coral Bleaching Data”, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KUVQKY, Harvard Dataverse, V1",

Australia and the Americas have the highest number of observations, both over 2000, due to the presence of extensive coral reef systems (e.g., the Great Barrier Reef) and stronger monitoring efforts. The Pacific and Asia follow with moderate observation counts, reflecting their significant reef areas but potentially less monitoring capacity compared to Australia and the Americas. Africa and the Middle East have the fewest observations, possibly due to smaller reef systems and limited monitoring resources.\n\n\nCode\ncountry_counts &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(BLEACHING_SEVERITY != \"Severity Unknown\") |&gt;\n  group_by(COUNTRY) |&gt;\n  summarize(num_observations = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(num_observations))\n\n# Cleveland dot plot\nggplot(country_counts, aes(x = num_observations, y = reorder(COUNTRY, num_observations))) +\n  geom_point(color = \"lightblue\", size = 1.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = COUNTRY), color = \"darkgray\", size = 0.5) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of Observations by Country\",\n    x = \"Number of Observations\",\n    y = \"Country\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 6)\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Cleveland dot plot displays the total number of observations for each country. Australia, particularly the Torres Strait & Great Barrier Reef region, dominates the data with the highest number of observations, reflecting its extensive reef system and well-funded research initiatives. Other countries, such as Mexico, Malaysia, and the United States (specifically Florida), also show high observation counts, likely due to their substantial reef coverage and strong conservation efforts. In contrast, many countries have significantly fewer observations, possibly indicating limited monitoring resources or smaller reef areas. The steep drop-off in observation counts after the top few countries highlights a variable global distribution of monitoring efforts.\n\n\nCode\ndf$BLEACHING_SEVERITY &lt;- factor(df$BLEACHING_SEVERITY)\n\n# Violin plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = REGION, y = as.numeric(BLEACHING_SEVERITY), fill = REGION)) + \n  geom_violin(trim = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(x = \"Region\", y= \"Bleaching Severity\", title = \"Violin Plot of Bleaching Severity by Region\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 6)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis violin plot demonstrates the distribution of bleaching severity across different regions, with the width of the violins representing the density of observations for each severity level. Bleaching severity ranges from lower values to higher values, providing insights into the most commonly observed severity levels within each region:\n\nAmericas & Australia: These regions exhibit a wide range of bleaching severity and diversity across every level. The Americas has more emphasis on lower levels (level 2) while Australia has higher severity levels (level 4).\nAfrica & Middle East: Africa shows a concentration of observations at lower severity levels, suggesting less frequent high-severity bleaching. Contrastly, the Middle East has a similar shape, but reversed—emphasizing higher severity levels.\nAsia & Pacific: These regions appear to have more uniform severity levels; however, the Pacific differs in that it demonstrates a significant increase in density at severity level 5, the highest of any region.\n\nThis visualization highlights the variation in bleaching severity across regions, and suggests that regions like Australia, the Americas, and the Pacific experience a broader spectrum of bleaching severity. This variability potentially reflects the presence of larger and more closely monitored reef systems. In contrast, regions like Africa and the Middle East may require additional monitoring to better understand coral health dynamics.",

Dense clusters of observations are evident in specific regions, likely corresponding to areas with extensive coral reef systems and high monitoring efforts.\nWe observe that the majority of high bleaching severity cases lie in the eastern hemisphere. Lighter and medium shaded points dominate the plot, suggesting that most observations are of lower to moderate severity. Furthermore, as shown by the lightest shade, there are areas where no bleaching was observed. This indicates that some regions remain unaffected despite nearby bleaching events. This further highlights that various spectrums of bleaching can coexist within the same location, or even on the same coral, in each region.\n\n\nCode\n# Get the top 3 countries based on number of observations\ntop_3_countries &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(BLEACHING_SEVERITY != \"Severity Unknown\") |&gt;\n  group_by(COUNTRY) |&gt;\n  summarize(num_observations = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(num_observations)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 3)\n\n# Filter data for the top 3 countries\ntop_3_countries_df &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(COUNTRY %in% top_3_countries$COUNTRY & BLEACHING_SEVERITY != \"Severity Unknown\")\n\n# Hexbin plot\nggplot(top_3_countries_df, aes(x = LON, y = LAT, fill = factor(BLEACHING_SEVERITY, levels = c(\"No Bleaching\", \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"HIGH\")))) + \n  geom_hex(alpha = 0.8, color = 'black', size = .3) + \n  facet_wrap(~COUNTRY, scales = \"free\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Hexbin Plot of Bleaching Severity by Country\",\n    x = \"Longitude\",\n    y = \"Latitude\",\n    fill = \"Bleaching Severity\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"No Bleaching\" = \"#FFCC99\",\n    \"Low\" = \"#FF9966\",\n    \"Medium\" = \"#FF6633\",\n    \"HIGH\" = \"#CC3300\"\n  )) +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10), \n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis hexbin plot portrays the spatial distribution of coral bleaching severity for the three countries with the highest number of observations: Malaysia, Mexico, and the Torres Strait & Great Barrier Reef region in Australia. Each hexagon represents the density level of observations within the region, with colors indicating bleaching severity levels from “No Bleaching” to “HIGH”.\nMalaysia has fewer total observations, distributed across all cardinal directions within the country. Most events show “No Bleaching”/“Low” to “Medium” levels of bleaching. Mexico has a moderate density of observations, primarily clustered along specific latitudes and longitudes. The reported values primarily consist of “Medium” in addition to “HIGH” severity events.\nAustralia (Torres Strait & Great Barrier Reef) demonstrates the highest concentration of observations.

The number of observations remained consistently low from the 1970s through the 1980s, with a notable spike occurring just before the year 2000. This spike may reflect a combination of intensified monitoring efforts, global warming impacts, or a particularly severe bleaching event. After this peak, the number of recorded events fluctuates, but remains higher than pre-2000 levels.\nIt is important to note that the consistently low observation counts before the 1990s may indicate limited monitoring rather than an absence of bleaching events.

Due to more limited data points in earlier decades, we interpolated a few missing years (primarily between 1970-1980) in order to achieve a continuous perspective. The severity ranges from 0 to 3, with higher values indicating more severe bleaching.\nThere is a notable rise in average bleaching severity beginning in the 1990s, aligning with trends in warming temperatures and increased coral stress. What is most alarming is the steep, upward trajectory post-2000, with the highest average severity occurring in the early 2010s.

Bleaching severity is slightly higher during the early months of the year, particularly February-April, compared to other months. July also exhibits a notable severity level comparable to that of March. Severity levels rise again in November, indicating a possible seasonal rebound.\nThis visualization suggests a seasonal component to coral bleaching, potentially driven by variations in ocean temperatures and environmental stressors. We would expect higher levels of bleaching to occur in the summer months; however, many regions exhibit typical “summer”/warmer water temperatures at different months of the year. This could explain why February experienced a high spike, as many regions (i.e. regions near the Caribbean and the Great Barrier Reef) experience warm oceanic temperatures in the winter months.",

    "text": "4.2 Usage\nThis interactive heatmap visualizes coral bleaching severity across various locations, using a color-coded system to represent different levels of bleaching. The map overlays geospatial data points based on latitude and longitude, with each point’s color indicating the severity of bleaching. Bleaching severity ranges across “No Bleaching”, “Low”, “Medium”, and “High”. Users can hover over or click on data points to view additional information if available for the observation, such as the location, collection date, coral species, depth, and environmental conditions. This interactive heatmap provides a more detailed and informative experience than a static 2D map by allowing users to access specific data points directly. This tool allows users to analyze patterns in coral bleaching and related factors, enhancing their understanding of coral health across diverse regions.",

    "text": "3.5 Summary\nOur analysis reveals several key insights about coral bleaching trends and their global impact. First, regions like Australia and the Americas dominate the number of observations, reflecting strong monitoring capacity, while Africa and the Middle East demonstrate significantly smaller numbers of observations, likely due to limited resources. Spatial distribution maps highlight the Great Barrier Reef as a hotspot for high-severity bleaching events, emphasizing the urgent need for conservation in the region. Temporal trends show a concerning increase in bleaching severity since the 1990s, closely tied to global warming and rising ocean temperatures. Seasonal patterns suggest a connection between bleaching events and warmer months, but variations across regions reflect differences in local climates.",

    "text": "Coral reefs play a major role in the overall health of not only marine life, but also our world. With the provided visualizations and insights, we hope to contribute to addressing our oceanic health crisis and emphasize the need for increased attention to the deteriorating health of the coral reefs.\nIt is important to note that the disparity in observation counts may highlight geographic biases in research and funding rather than actual differences in bleaching severity. This disparity could lead to underrepresentation and severe underestimates of coral bleaching in regions with fewer resources. Increasing monitoring in underrepresented regions, like Africa and the Middle East, may help build a more comprehensive global understanding of coral bleaching. This data emphasizes the importance of targeted conservation efforts in regions with high observation counts and the need for equitable global research efforts.\nKey recommendations include increasing global monitoring efforts, particularly in underrepresented countries, to create a more comprehensive understanding of coral reef health. Our graphs underscore the need for equitable research funding and international collaboration to address geographic biases in the data. In addition, they highlight the need to provide more up-to-date coral health measurements that can accurately indicate the severity of coral bleaching in future years. Our visualizations show that coral bleaching is rapidly increasing with time, and the significant bleaching challenges faced in the Torres Strait & Great Barrier Reef require urgent conservation action. The high density of observations along the reef’s entire extent reflects its importance as a global conservation priority and the focus of significant monitoring resources.\nFurther analysis could focus on understanding environmental factors contributing to severity variations in specific regions, such as observation depth, sea surface temperature, or nutrient concentrations. Collectively, these visualizations and analyses stress the growing impacts of climate change on coral reefs and highlight the need for targeted interventions to mitigate environmental stressors.",
